# Arduino-indicator library
This library is intended to facilitate one or more LEDs, used as indicator in small devices
based on ESP8266, ESP32 or Arduino. It is capable of configuring different blinking patterns,
and selecting them in different parts of the program.

As an example, you cann use it to indicate different operating modes, like setup, normal
operation and error conditions.

# Notes
This is work under construction. Examples will be included soon.
