# Arduino-indicator library
This library is intended to facilitate one or more LEDs, used as indicator to small devices
based on ESP8266, ESP32 or Arduino. It is capable of configuring different blinking patterns,
and selecting them in different parts of the program.

# Notes
This is work under construction. Examples will be included soon.
